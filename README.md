# filer

*filer* is a library that aims to contain a bunch of useful file IO functions in
one place. The functions are mostly related to bulk operations such as bulk
content modification, bulk generation and bulk assertion.

There are different namespaces for different file types, but of course some
functions can be used on file types other than the one defined by the namespace
name. `dir.core` has functions for directory manipulation. `txt.core` has
functions for text file generation and modification. Namespace `xml.core`
currently has only one function that performs a XML file validity check against
an XSD file. Finally, `html.code` namespace focuses on assertion upon HTML file
structure and content.

#### `html.core` namespace

This namespace was created with a specific role in mind - HTML content and
structure assertion. The domain where this idea arose is mass mailing systems.
There is a need to check the output e-mail's structure and content during
testing in order to be sure that the perfect presentation arrives to the
destination.

The idea for the shape of the functions is inspired by this *Ruby on Rails*
[method](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionDispatch/Assertions/SelectorAssertions/assert_select).

## Usage

### `dir.core`

```clojure
(require '[org.theparanoidtimes.filer.dir.core :as dir])
=> nil

(def test-dir "/test-dir/")
=> #'user/test-dir

;; Takes a directory name prefix and a number of directories that should be
;; generated. Outputted directories have names '/test-dit/t0', '/test-dit/t1'.
(dir/generate-n-directories (str test-dir "t") 2)
=> nil

;; Takes a directory name and returns a seq of all files in it. Returns files
;; from nested directories, but not the directories themselves.
(dir/files-in-directory test-dir)
=>
(#object[java.io.File 0x5e24856c "/test-dir/1/1one.txt"]
 #object[java.io.File 0x3330c88a "/test-dir/one.txt"]
 #object[java.io.File 0x2606def2 "/test-dir/three.html"]
 #object[java.io.File 0x62d732f9 "/test-dir/two.xml"])

;; Can also take a set of file extensions and then return files only of the
;; specified type/s.
(dir/files-in-directory test-dir #{".txt"})
=>
(#object[java.io.File 0x5772de8a "/test-dir/1one.txt"]
 #object[java.io.File 0x8701197 "/test-dir/one.txt"])
```

### `txt.core`

```clojure
(require '[org.theparanoidtimes.filer.txt.core :as txt])
=> nil

;; Takes a prefix, a number of files to generate, a file extension and the
;; initial text of the generated files. Outputted files have names
;; /test-dir/t0.txt' and '/test-dir/t1.txt'.
(txt/generate-n-files (str test-dir "t") 2 ".txt" "Test")
=> nil

;; Files generated...
(dir/files-in-directory test-dir)
=>
(#object[java.io.File 0x65598480 "/test-dir/t0.txt"]
 #object[java.io.File 0x3ed5dd8f "/test-dir/t1.txt"])

;; Takes a file, a string to replace and a string for replacement and replaces
;; all occurrences in the file.
(txt/replace-text-in-file (io/file "/test-dir/t0.txt") "T" "t")
=> nil

;; Text in the file is changed...
(slurp (io/file "/test-dir/t0.txt"))
=> "test"

;; Takes a file and a string for replacement and replaces the whole text in the
;; file with it.
(txt/replace-whole-text-in-file (io/file "/test-dir/t0.txt") "changed")
=> nil

;; Text in the file is changed...
(slurp (io/file "/test-dir/t0.txt"))
=> "changed"

;; Alternative to the replace-text-in-file function for multiple files. Replaces all
;; occurrences in all files. Can take a file extensions set.
(txt/replace-text-in-files test-dir "T" "t")
=> nil

;; Alternative to the replace-whole-text-in-file function for multiple files. Can take
;; a file extensions set.
(txt/replace-whole-text-in-files test-dir "changed")
=> nil

;; A special case function that generates files for each line of the provided
;; names list file. Each line is an input to the name decorator function. The
;; output of the function is the name of the generated file.
(txt/generate-files-from-names-list (str test-dir "names") s/upper-case "Test")
=> nil
```

### `xml.core`

```clojure
(require '[org.theparanoidtimes.filer.xml.core :as xml])
=> nil

;; Validates the given xml file against the xsd file.
(xml/validate-xml-against-xsd xml-file xsd-file)
=> true
```

### `html.core`

There is only one main function in this namespace and it is `assert-select`. This
function takes an HTML document, a node path declaration and the assertion
function which must be a predicate. It will than select the specified node or
nodes and apply the assertion function on it/them. The function utilizes
[enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) library and node path are defined
via *enlive* selectors. See the
[selectors explanation](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive#selectors)
on *enlive* library's GitHub page for more info.

```clojure
(require '[org.theparanoidtimes.filer.html.core :as html])
=> nil

;; A test HTML file (prettified)
(slurp test-html)
=>
"<!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
 <title>Test</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <h1>My First Heading</h1>
 <a href="#">Home</a>
 </body>
 </html>"

;; Try to assert if h1 content is string, but it fails.
(html/assert-select test-html [:h1] string?)
=> false

;; The reason is that the complete enlive node map is provided to the predicate
;; not just the content. We need to extract the content string so we can assert
;; on it. Content is a list so we need to take the first and only element from it.
(html/assert-select test-html [:h1] (fn [node] (string? (-> node :content first))))
=> true

;; If we need equality assertion we just change the assertion function
(html/assert-select test-html [:h1] (fn [nodes] (= "My First Heading" (-> nodes :content first))))
=> true

;; There is a helper function for this.
(html/assert-select test-html [:h1] (html/content=? "My First Heading"))
=> true

;; There are a few helper function defined for some common assertions. Two of
;; them are used for assertion upon links.
;; Link target...
(html/assert-select test-html [:a] (html/link-target=? "#"))
=> true

;; And link name...
(html/assert-select test-html [:a] (html/link-name=? "Home"))
=> true
```
